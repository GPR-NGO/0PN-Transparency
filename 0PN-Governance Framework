The presentation of an 0PN System Architecture requires first a clear and inclusive data control governance privacy risk model, which is inclusive, non-discriminatory, and empowering.
 Resultibg propose a trustworthy id system architecture, which address the governance and risk vectors highlighted from a human centric data control perspective.  the premise is trustworthy id is achieved through records i control and use then use to engage with 3rd parties. Rather than records that are controlled for me.  

Part 1: Governance & Risk 

In governance and risk discourse, legal instruments and modelling we identified through our research that a vector of governance - personal data control has largely been missing.  As a result the architecture presented first focuses on the control vector of personal data, then applies a privacy risk and security assurance model in accordance with security requirements of this vector.  

There are 3 vectors of digital identity governance which has different privacy risks and security considerations for trustworthy digital identifier management  

1. Personal Data Control - requires decentralized data governance and identifier management 

2. Co-Regulated Data Control - requires distributed data controls and identifier management. 

3. Data Protection - requires centralized data control and federated identity management.  

 

Each vector of data control governance has 3 tiers/levels of digital identifier risk assurance  

1.Self asserted - Controller Credential - usable for hyper localized - in person privacy risk assessment 

2. Authoritative - Controller  Credential - verified data controller and  data protection officer, or company director, in a jurisdiction where privacy is enforced  

3. Assured - Controller  - operator of a personal data control (eConsent) code of practice, which in addition to tier 2, is certified and monitored by recognized provider/regulator for a specific set of data control and management practices 

  

Which vector and what tier can be determined with a data control impact assessment. which involves the assessment of who controls a digital identifier, how many parties it is disclosed too, what is the security when disclosed to indicate the scope of privacy risk.  WHo is the beneficial owner? 

  

Trustworthy ID System Architecture 

Electronic Notice and Consent Governance Architecture is presented here for digital identity management, in which digital identity represents a high risk, alpha surveillance technology.  

This technology presents a prevalent security risk in which people are assigned identifiers, referenced as meta-data, which is then surveilled/tracked to observe sentiment and interest.   An electronic notice record and consent record receipt can be used to mirror the record of processing and be verified/notarized for itâ€™s further utilitiy as a micro-credential or token.  

ZKP can then be used,
