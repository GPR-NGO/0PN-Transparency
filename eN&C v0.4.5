Status of this document

Outlined Draft v0.4.5

This specification references and contributes to multiple work efforts, the record fields are from ISO/IEC 29100 Privacy and Security Techniques, which is an open and free ISO/IEC standard. 

This framework is designed for human centric decentralized data Governance for -Business, Legal and Technical interoperability between people and digital services. From the social legal research the Consent Receipt specification and systems work has inspired.  This 'consent receipt' specification distinguishes  between the legal privacy regulation and human/analogue notice and consent requirements and electronic notice and consent requirements. 

Utilizing design principles for human trust and surveillance infrastructure, (ref: Royal Academy of Engineering) in which digital transparency is specified with equivalent notice and consent fields, like the digital identity of a PII Controller, the beneficial owner of data processing, the privacy rights contact end point and specified to support the operationalization of security and privacy infrastructure. 

In this regard, the scope of this specification is to outline the framework and point to other laws, standards and specifications that provide the detailed legal to technical policy information requirements required to operate the information structure specified.  Restricting the scope of this document to the technical.

Specification Roadmap

This specification aims to pull together existing information and make place holders for those components that are evolving or development. The full record and receipt information structure specification is framed with 5 sections which are being worked on by different community groups and efforts also introduced in this overview.

July 2022: Sect 1: ANCR Record Draft
Aug 2022: Sect 2: Comment Inclusive on ISO/IEC 27560 
Sep 2022: Sect 3: Draft 1 of 108+Profile with DPV

Section Summaries
Section 1: Anchored Notice Record

A key element missing in online only interactions is proof of informed or knowledgeable consent and the risks associated with this notice. The objective is to work through the fields in sections and to specify a way to generate consent receipts by both PII Principal and PII Controller. 

By working through the first ANCR Record section we aim to complete the first deliverable, in which a report will be made and the next section can be reviewed. The ANCR record starts at the beginning of the information structure to create an open record.  

Section 1:  topics under review
Dynamic Data Controls
Dynamic Fields:
default consent types for the ANCR Record 
Generating a Receipt for another legal justification
generating a receipt under the authority of a) PII Principal, b) PII Controller, c) Both 
Privacy Rights Agreement - Specifying the legal privacy rules according to the jurisdiction 
Jurisdiction of PII principal for determining  rights access.  (right to complain and be heard) 
Adding a notice payload to a consent receipt 
Rendering a receipt to display the proof of notice 
Rendering the receipt to display notification
Rending a receipt for privacy rights access information. 
Default notice rendering
Verifying rights access and performance
 PII Principle is a verified claim when provided by the individual. 
How can this claim be verified
Section 2: Purpose Specification 

In the Consent Receipt v1.2.2 section  focus and discussion on the consent record information structure, utilizing the GDPR an Internationally adopted (ISO 29184) legal processing justification categories

 purpose specification fields (are for the most part the same as v1.1)
 purpose context - legal justification of processing - instance(s) of processing, purpose categories, 
 purpose specification for 6 legal justifications
specifying rights requests and data processing controls
The rights are then listed with the legal justification in the next sections of the receipt.  

The GDPR rights specification are used here for example, as a privacy agreement enforced in many countries it provides the current International standard for privacy rights.  

Note:  A consent receipt can be specified for only one legal justification  and one purpose (or purpose bundle). 

Section 3: Data Control, Protection & Treatment

This section is an expansion of the receipt fields to further specify the scope of the legal processing of personal information for a specified purpose.  Assuring a purpose limitation principle. 

 of Provides the fields for the technical capture of personal data processing, separating storage, access and privacy rights that apply for the specified legal justification and context.

This section focus discussion on.

 additional fields for specifying privacy rights that are available and the scope of permission that are accessible to the PII Principle. 
Consent Grant Conditions
Withdraw Permission for a Consent Grant
Privacy Rights Applicable for this processing context
Notice of Risk and Liabilities Required in place (or in addition) to contract terms or license agreements
Notifications : the required notice, notifications, and disclosures for valid processing. This is a new section, which is in early review and development. 
Privacy/ Security -  Change & Notification Log, required for records of processing, for open, operational and responsive Online privacy notification. 
Section 4:  Code of Conduct & Practice (Optional)

Extending the Privacy Agreement (or legislation) with a technical code of conduct or practice,  which can be notified with a badge and icon,  provide transparency over additional safeguards and measures (aka privacy preserving technology)  that provide additional privacy assurances, in addition to a more streamlined privacy service user experience.

Discussion includes: 

A code of conduct, which extends privacy legislation and is approved by a privacy regulator. 
a code of practice, which extends a specified purpose with additional codified practices which are either specified by the Notice Controller, or with a certified and audited/auditable practice. 

These additional options can be used to bundle like purposes together, specify each purpose for a consistent and standard processing, streamline experiential use by presenting enhanced practices with a valid/authorised badge, icon, or micro-credential. .

Section 5: Field Input Data Field Sources (UNCL)

The specification of the field data for each section will be collated and combined, including the data sources and specified and referenced according to the OECD Guidelines, Standards, regulatory guidance and legislation.

The long term aim of this section is to Unify the Notice Control   Language (UNCL) iterating towards a notice centric Ontology. Mapping privacy agreement vocabularies with the ISO 29100 terms and definitions and W3C Data Privacy Vocabulary, for machine readable semantics. 

Unified fields data - for purpose specification which harmonizes context - for decentralized governance referring to a consent by default status.

explicit consent - e.g. providing personal information for a legal specified purpose and privacy rights notice (assumes meaningful and informed digital consent)
expressed (or directed) consent - e.g. an explicit consent that is specified by the PII Principal 
altruistic consent - e.g. a consent specified with a code of practice rather that to a specific legal entity (name of controller not necessarily provided)

Sect 1: Generating a Notice Record
Generate a Notice Record,
this is created from the assessing the notice information, presentation, layered information and policy
Generate a  Notice Reciept
once the record is generated assess the record with a conformance profile specified from ISO 29184, or from regulation or international practice
generate receipt, which is a digital twin of the notice record, and include the results from this assessment aimed to  providing rights information and access
Generate a Consent Notice Receipt.
Utilizing the Notice Receipt, specify which rights, and generate a consent notice receipt for the PII Controller,  
Receiving a Consent Notice Reciept
There are multiple ways to source, validate and verify the valid state of privacy signalled with the record and receipt 
All of the technical information and records of processing are linked to the receipt and is usable to automate the response. 




ANCR Record & Blinding Identity Taxonomy for Consent Receipt Identifier Management 

Their are 2 identifiers used in the receipts 

1. is the ANCR Record iD which is anchored to the PII Controller Notice and the PII Principal's capture of the notice (or equivalent) 

2. The Consent receipt iD that is generated when a PII Principle interacts with the notice, context of a sign or notification




Acronyms

BT = Blinding Taxonomy  is a field that is encrypted, and blinded, so as not be available at rest without a key, in this specification, these fields are blinded by the PII Principal’s User Agent. (BUAT)  If these fields are generated by a 3rd party or controller, then this data is not ‘required’ in this is specification.
