open source governance control transparency tools and frameworks works for the 

0PN - eNotary - id transparency and risk governance  model which applies a data control transparency assessment to records captured with this open source specification, 

The framework for creating an eNotice record and eConsent receipt for checking the privacy state and performance of the controls. 

This involves capturing legally required  public privacy info about the control of personal information into a transparency record, or zero public network record (0PN-R)

This repo’s objective is to specify eNotice Records and Receipts  : 
1. Creating a Record
2. Assessing the record 
3. Using the record 

In accordance with  the 0PN - Data Control Governance Model & Impact Assessment 

This open source repository for global privacy rights covers: 

1. GPR - Notice Controller Record
2. GPR - Notice Controller Record Assessment 
3. GPR - Notice Controller Record and Consent Receipt 

Capturing the credential
- creating the record in accordance with the Kantara Initiative ANCR WG Specification 
- assessing if there is enough information to make a notice controller record 
- testing the performance of transparency

Differential Transparency

A, create the record
B, assess if enough information to make a credential 
C, data control impact assessment
D, generate an eConsent notice receipt

0PN-Ctrl’r Assessment

Once the record is created

1. to First identify;  Which of the 3 vectors of identity governance control an identifier is being governed from 
a. Personal Data Control (decentralized transparency identifiers) 
b. Co-Regulation - Distributed Identifiers
c. Data Protection - Federated identifiers 
2. to Then identify, which of the 3 level of risk assurance is required, before assessing / listing risks, then measures which mitigate the risks
d. transparency performance test - to test the performance of risk mitigation presented through the controller credential information 

Next Milestone in Roadmap
