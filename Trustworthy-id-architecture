The Benefits - Why eNotice and Consent makes trustworthy iD? 
1.	 Security against misinformation -—Digital Transparency  (once standardized in electronic notice, reveals which organization is in control of digital identifiers and who the accountable person is in each organization. Address a key cyber security flaw in digital identity, which is surveillance/authentication of identifiers before authority is provided, or authorization. This security flaw is the key indicator to un-trustworthy digital id. 
2.	Two Factor Notice – is a standardized notice usable for all data processing. E.g. a QR Code on a video surveillance sign, or with a differential transparency icon that displays a differential transparency signal online. When interacted with, a new record and receipt (mirrored record) is provided and signed by a notary. All two factor notices have 3 mandatory buttons, for consent, reject, and privacy rights/ dynamic data controls that are proportionate and reciprocal. 
3.	The use of Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) – Rather that every service authenticating everyone's identifiers, a PII Principal can generate a micro-credential from a Controller’s Credential specific to the purpose of their relationship. This can be signed, notarized and attached to a consent token, so authentication can be achieved with ZKP rather than with digital identifiers using a protocol like GNAP (Oauth3). 
4.	Inclusion, diversity, cultural considerations, low tech access and infrastructure challenges are addressed with the use of standards that provide a single rights user-interface for all services with standards – rather terms and conditions, for enforcing accessibility to data controls not dependent on the tech alone (aka un-trustworhty digital identity services)
